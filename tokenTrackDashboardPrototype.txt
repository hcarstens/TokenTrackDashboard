Project: Build a working prototype for Token Track Dashboard.
Core Concept:
- A platform for tracking tokenization progress via
stablecoins, CBDCs, and↪
- tokenized deposits with dashboards and metrics to identify
imbalances and↪
- unintended consequences.
Key Features:

- Metrics for spotting imbalances, stress testing scenarios,
and mapping↪
- unintended consequences
- Integration with unlikely sources like economic indicators or
social sentiment↪

Mission Snapshot:
- Primary audience: Financial institutions, regulators, fintech
startups, and↪
- investors interested in blockchain-based financial
innovations at a national↪

stress testing;↪
- use drag-and-drop components for user flows like data
visualization and scenario↪
- simulation; integrate sample APIs for financial data.
Workspace Setup:
- Set up pages: Home, Dashboard, Metrics Analyzer, Stress Test
Simulator↪
- Define data types: TokenData (fields: type, volume, supply,
volatility),↪
- UserPreferences (fields: custom_metrics, alerts)
- Configure permissions: Public access for viewing, user login
for customizations↪
Execution Priorities:
- Add AI-driven anomaly detection to flag imbalances
automatically↪
- Incorporate user-customizable dashboards for different
stakeholder views↪
- Include simulation tools for stress testing unintended
consequences↪
- Integrate data from non-financial sources like supply chain
metrics↪
- Enhance with collaborative features for shared scenario
analysis↪
- Optimize for mobile access to enable on-the-go monitoring
- Implement privacy-preserving data aggregation to comply with
regulations↪
- Next step: Gather initial data samples from stablecoin and
CBDC sources↪
- Next step: Design wireframes for core dashboards and metrics
- Next step: Conduct internal stress tests on prototype metrics

custom setups >70%↪
Operating Assumptions:
- Stablecoin and CBDC data remains publicly accessible
- National regulations support tokenization tracking tools
Open Questions:
- What specific unintended consequences should be prioritized
in metrics?↪
- How to ensure data accuracy from diverse sources?

native components before↪
- writing custom code.
- Prototype the golden path end-to-end before layering
variations or edge cases.↪
- Favor stubs or mock data over complex integrations until the
interaction is↪
- proven.
- Annotate TODOs or questions inline so the next builder can
continue momentum.↪
- Prefer clarity, testability, and demo readiness over clever
abstractions.↪
Guidelines:
- At decision points default to simpler implementations.
- Iterate until you have a working prototype or need clarifying
instructions.↪
